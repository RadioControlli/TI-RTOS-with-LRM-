 TI-RTOS Overview TI-RTOS is a real-time operating system for TI microcontrollers. TI-RTOS enables faster development by eliminating the need for developers to write and maintain system software such as schedulers, protocol stacks and drivers. It combines a real-time multitasking kernel with additional middleware components including TCP/IP and USB stacks, a FAT file system, and device drivers, enabling developers to focus on differentiating their application. TI-RTOS provides a consistent embedded software platform across TIâ€™s microcontroller devices, making it easy to port legacy applications to the latest devices.
